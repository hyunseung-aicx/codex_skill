description: Guided developer learning framework for pairing with Codex or Claude. Use when the user wants to learn while coding, practice implementation, split work between AI and human, or receive structured frontend/backend growth tasks with TODO markers and explanations.

# Developer Growth Framework

Guided learning skill. Activate with `/developer-growth` or when user asks to learn.

## Mode: Guided (70/30)
- Claude writes ~70%, marks ~30% for human implementation
- Use `// TODO(human): <task description>` markers
- After each task, suggest 1-2 concepts to study deeper

---

## Frontend Growth Path

### Level 1: Foundations
- **Component Structure**: Explain props/state flow before writing. Ask human to implement simple components.
- **CSS Layout**: Explain flexbox/grid mental models. `// TODO(human): convert this layout to grid`
- **Event Handling**: Show patterns, let human wire up interactions

### Level 2: Intermediate
- **State Management**: Explain when to lift state vs use context vs external store
- **Performance**: Teach React.memo, useMemo, useCallback with real examples
- **Accessibility**: Explain ARIA patterns, keyboard navigation. `// TODO(human): add keyboard support`

### Level 3: Advanced
- **Custom Hooks**: Show extraction pattern, let human create hooks
- **Animation**: Explain UX principles behind motion decisions
- **Architecture**: Component composition vs inheritance, render props vs hooks

### Teaching Pattern
```
1. Show the problem (broken/naive code)
2. Explain the principle (why it matters)
3. Demonstrate the solution (working code)
4. Mark practice area: // TODO(human): apply this pattern to [component]
```

---

## Backend Growth Path

### Level 1: Foundations
- **REST Design**: Explain resource naming, HTTP methods, status codes
- **Validation**: Show zod/joi patterns. `// TODO(human): add validation for this endpoint`
- **Error Handling**: Explain error propagation strategy

### Level 2: Intermediate
- **Database Design**: Explain normalization, indexing decisions
- **Auth/Authz**: Walk through JWT/session flow, RBAC design
- **Testing**: Show integration test patterns for APIs

### Level 3: Advanced
- **Architecture**: Explain hexagonal/clean architecture trade-offs
- **CQRS/Events**: When and why to separate read/write
- **Performance**: N+1 queries, connection pooling, caching strategies

### Teaching Pattern
```
1. Design the API contract together (types first)
2. Explain architectural decision (why this pattern)
3. Implement core logic (Claude writes)
4. Mark extension points: // TODO(human): add [feature] following this pattern
```

---

## AI/ML Growth Path

### Level 1: Foundations
- **Prompt Engineering**: Explain system/user message design, few-shot patterns
- **API Integration**: Show Anthropic/OpenAI SDK usage patterns
- **Structured Output**: JSON mode, tool use for reliable parsing

### Level 2: Intermediate
- **RAG Basics**: Explain embedding, chunking, retrieval pipeline
- **Agent Patterns**: ReAct loop, tool use, planning
- **Evaluation**: How to measure LLM output quality

### Level 3: Advanced
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Orchestration, delegation, consensus
- **Fine-tuning**: When and how to fine-tune vs prompt engineer
- **Production**: Observability, cost optimization, fallbacks

### Teaching Pattern
```
1. Explain the concept with a mental model diagram
2. Show minimal working example
3. Discuss trade-offs (cost, latency, quality)
4. // TODO(human): modify the prompt/pipeline for [new requirement]
```

---

## Infrastructure Growth Path

### Level 1: Foundations
- **Docker**: Explain containerization concept, write Dockerfile together
- **CI/CD**: Show GitHub Actions workflow, explain each step
- **Environment**: Dev/staging/prod separation, env vars

### Level 2: Intermediate
- **Kubernetes**: Explain pods, services, deployments conceptually
- **IaC**: Terraform basics, state management
- **Monitoring**: Logs, metrics, traces overview

### Level 3: Advanced
- **Scaling**: Horizontal vs vertical, auto-scaling decisions
- **Security**: Network policies, secrets management, least privilege
- **Cost**: Resource optimization, right-sizing

### Teaching Pattern
```
1. Explain the infrastructure concept (what problem it solves)
2. Show the configuration/code
3. Explain failure modes (what can go wrong)
4. // TODO(human): modify the config for [scenario]
```
